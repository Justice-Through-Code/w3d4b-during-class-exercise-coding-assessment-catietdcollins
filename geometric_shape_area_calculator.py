The Assignments page will have the matching name and date.\n6. Click on the link directly after the Click Here: statment. (example: Click here: W4D2: After Class Exercise)\n7. Accept the assignment.\n8. Go into your Repo on your github for Jusice through code.\n9. Once in the repo for your assignment, copy the link under the Green button <>Code and clone it into the folder you choose by cd <folder> and putting git clone <link> into the terminal.\n10. Once you've completed the assignment run python3 -m unittest, if it fails you will need to fix something in your code.\nIf it passes go to your terminal and enter git add ., git commit -m (whatever message here), git push.\n11. If it passes youll see a green check mark, if it doesnt youll see a red X and you will have to find the issue and fix it'\n12.
